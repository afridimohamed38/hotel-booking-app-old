Planning Method in OOP:
1. List out the overall requirements in bullet points.
2. Figure out which classes to be created
3. Look for nouns in the requirements to find class names/logic
4. Start writing/coding the classes with pass statement
5. Think about what methods each class can have.
6. To place methods in correct classes the method should relate like {method} what {class} eg: def book() -> Hotel class

Hotel booking app:

Finding out to classes to be used:
